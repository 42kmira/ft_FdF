# ft_FdF

This is the first of the graphics projects in the graphics branch. This project involves reading a map, some example maps
are in the [maps folder](https://github.com/42kmira/ft_FdF/tree/master/maps), and converting that map into a 3D wireframe.
It uses a basic graphics library, one that interacts with the kernel to announce key events, make a window, and draw raw pixels on said window,
called minilibx.

This project was entirely done in C. Rotations, translation and zoom were implemented from scratch. How keys down and up presses are handled
was up to the user. The controls are:

Rotation:

```
Numpad 8
Numpad 2
Numpad 4
Numpad 6
```

Translation:
```
Arrow Left
Arrow Right
Arrow Up
Arrow Down
```

Zoom:
```
Z
X
```

Change Map Height:
```
<
>
```
